Machine Learning projects developed during Microsoft TÃ¼rkiye internship - Sleep efficiency prediction model

Mentor: Barboros Gunay

## Project Objectives

Predict sleep efficiency using machine learning algorithms. Identify key factors affecting sleep quality. Develop a practical tool for sleep quality assessment. Apply data science skills in a real-world corporate environment.

## Technologies Used

Python - Core programming language  
Google Colab - Development environment  
Pandas & NumPy - Data manipulation and analysis  
Scikit-learn - Machine learning library (RandomForest Regressor)  
Matplotlib & Seaborn - Data visualization  
Kaggle API - Dataset integration
